In the home page, you can click menu and cart. since there is nothing in cart. the cart page is empty.
In the menu page, only bubble tea can be clicked. After clicking Add, if I click on the cart, it is still empty. Detecting whether a user has added a product is more technical.
So please click checkout, this will lead to payment page.
